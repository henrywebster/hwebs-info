## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer

I am new to JavaScript, React, and front-end development as a whole.
If you notice some ugly code, please [open an issue](https://github.com/henrywebster/hwebs-info/issues/new) explaining how I can make it better.
I welcome this sort of knowledge sharing!
I know I have a lot to learn.
