## About Me
My name is **Henry J. Webster**, `hwebs` for short.

I work as a **Lead Software Engineer** at [Prism Data](https://prismdata.com), the leading cash flow underwriting solution. There I’m part of a small but mighty team and wear many hats, from developing to operating to customer-supporting and beyond.

I’m an avid **do-it-yourself**-er. I got interested in tech to build stuff. I also enjoy making [music](https://hwebs.info/etc), graphics, photography, and furniture for my apartment.
