## What is this place?

It's my own tiny nook of the internet. I try my best to keep hobby projects like this  light-hearted: for fun and not profit, unafraid to show some **pencil marks**. 

Why have my own hand-written website in this day and age? My **goal** is to hack on code and infuse some seriously lacking personality to the Giga-platform-world. 

I don't share often on social media, but I do have a [/now](/now) page for a glimpse of what I've been up to recently. I also have a [/blog](/blog) for longer-form ideas.

A custom website can't convey a whole person, just like a social media profile can't. I only hope that the realm beyond the content—its texture and **tomfoolery**—give unqiue insight into my interests and values that couldn't happen anywhere else. I encourage everyone to make something like this for themselves (and send it to me.)

Please let me know if you enjoy (or despise!) the site, in person or through my contact info. I don't track any analytics—this is supposed to be **fun**—so I have no idea if anybody is looking.
