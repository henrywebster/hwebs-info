In my last year of high school, I had to take graduation photos.
We were told to bring some props that showcased our interests.
I loved playing music, so an instrument would be a natural choice.
Being the cranky teenager I was, I thought the whole exercise was _corny_.
Rather than my beloved black Fender Strat, I brought a toy keyboard I found at a thrift store.
There was a questionnaire to fill out before the shoot. 
When asked to describe my personal style, I put: 'Manchester, 1980s.'

When I wrote that answer, I was thinking of Factory Records and people like New Order's bassist Peter Hook.
Reading his book _[The Haçienda: How Not to Run a Club](https://factoryrecords.org/cerysmatic/the_hacienda_how_not_to_run_a_club.php)_, we get a front-row seat to the life of the club at the center of it all.
I hadn't read the book at the time, but I had a love for everything they were doing: the sounds, the looks, the graphics, the atmosphere.

Why did a suburban Chicago kid think post-industrial, austerity-era Northern England was the place to be?
The eye-popping schedules provided by Hook are the strongest evidence.
From Manchester alone: The Smiths, The Duratti Column, Pete Shelley, and (of course) New Order.
From out-of-town: Tears for Fears, Alan Vega, Cocteau Twins, The Cramps, The Pogues.
These musicians make up a sizable portion of my attention for the past 15 years and counting.
To have them playing in once place, in such a small span of time, is astounding.
Brian Eno coined "scenius" to describe this phenomenon:

> I became (and still am) more and more convinced that the important changes in cultural history were actually the product of very large numbers of people and circumstances conspiring to make something new. I call this ‘scenius’ — it means ‘the intelligence and intuition of a whole cultural scene’. It is the communal form of the concept of genius.[^1]

Factory Records and the broader Manchester scene fit this description perfectly, with the club becoming a physical locus for that collective energy.

The closest experience I've had to the Haçienda is Knockdown Center in Brooklyn.
I lived within walking distance most of my time in New York and it was one of the first places I went to.
It has the cavernous, industrial setting and the wide array of musical styles.
Over the years I've seen acts from Turnstile, to SOPHIE, to Godspeed You! Black Emperor there.
Knockdown Center grew on me because it catered to a variety of artistic voices, just like the Haçienda.

At the same time, it never felt like it was building a scene like the Haç.
There were some NYC acts I saw, like Parquet Courts and Avalon Emerson, but it was more artists who had already honed their craft, rather than a primordial hot tub.
It could be due to how differently scenes are shaped with the internet.
Another point of contrast: Knockdown is very well run, and I always felt safe.
In the end, the lengths the Haçienda went to experiment were unsustainable, even if culturally valuable.
It's not surprising future club owners wouldn't want to replicate its formula.
It's also possible I simply wasn't paying enough attention during my time there to notice a developing network.

Looking back on when I took that graduation photo, I was being spiteful.
After a couple of years, I felt bad about being such a brat.
Now, I can't help but laugh and appreciate the memory.
If I had gotten what I wanted at the time, there wouldn't be any photo.
I wouldn't have any story to tell.
Whatever I've learned since then, I can't go back to that period and do it differently.
For that time, at that place, that was _me_, and anything else couldn't have been.

Running the club took a huge toll on everyone involved, financially and personally.
Despite all the suffering, I know why Hook is wistful.
So much grew out of that club, even if it never went according to plan.
They created a place so peculiar it inspired me across decades and across an ocean.
It was messy, but a reflection of that time and place, and if it played out any other way it couldn't have been the Haçienda.

_While I was reading, I broke out my copy of_ [Factory Records: The Complete Graphic Album](https://factoryrecords.org/cerysmatic/fac461_factory_records_the_complete_graphic_album.php) _by Matthew Robertson. It ended up being an excellent companion with plenty of Haçienda ephemera to pore over with new insight._
